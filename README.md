# Social-Media-Prediction
 The main task for the data challenge is to predict the number of 'likes' for given details about the simulated profiles of users on social media.
# Prerequisite:
Make sure the dataset is linked under the following directory/load the competition dataset in Kaggle,
/kaggle/input/ift6758-a20/... or, The data path file has been written to run it on Kaggle notebooks, rename the path file if required.

The codes require pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, mlxtend-0.18.0, os, random, and warnings libraries to run.
Please update mlxtend to the latest version(0.18.0) before running it.(Kaggle notebook uses mlxtend-0.18.0 by default, hence no need to update here).

# Steps to run the program:
Step 1: run any notebook ie. ipynb

Step 2: A csv file will be generated (model prediction on the test data after training)
